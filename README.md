A little thing I made to help me understand memory and how a CPU works at a base level. 
I'm not sure if its perfectly accurate and I know that an actual CPU would have dozen more commands. 
Its fun to play around in and try and create different basic algorithms but can be pretty confusing and frustrating if you try somethin a bit too complicated.

There are a few example programs you can try. To switch between them, change the filename parameter for the run() function at the bottom of main.py:

examples.quantum - examples on how the different instructions work

functions.quantum - a crude (but kinda clever) method of creating functions

file.quantum - just a little program that prints a series of numbers based on an start/end point and step. These numbers are also stored in memory.
