A little thing I made to help me understand memory and how a CPU works at a base level. 
I'm not sure if its perfectly accurate and I know that an actual CPU would have dozen more commands. 
Its fun to play around in and try and create different basic algorithms but can be pretty confusing and frustrating if you try somethin a bit too complicated.
